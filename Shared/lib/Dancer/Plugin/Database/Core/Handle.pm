=head1 NAME

Dancer::Plugin::Database::Core::Handle - subclassed DBI connection handle

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Subclassed DBI connection handle with added convenience features


=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # in your Dancer app:
  database->quick_insert($tablename, \%data);

  # Updating a record where id = 42:
  database->quick_update($tablename, { id => 42 }, { foo => 'New value' });

  # Fetching a single row quickly in scalar context
  my $employee = database->quick_select('employees', { id => $emp_id });

  # Fetching multiple rows in list context - passing an empty hashref to signify
  # no where clause (i.e. return all rows -  so "select * from $table_name"):
  my @all_employees = database->quick_select('employees', {});

  # count number of male employees
  my $count = database->quick_count('employees', { gender => 'male' });

=head1 Added features

A C<Dancer::Plugin::Database::Handle> object is a subclassed L<DBI::db> L<DBI>
database handle, with the following added convenience methods:

=over 4

=item quick_insert

  database->quick_insert('mytable', { foo => 'Bar', baz => 5 });

Given a table name and a hashref of data (where keys are column names, and the
values are, well, the values), insert a row in the table.

If you need any of the values to be interpolated straight into the SQL, for
instance if you need to use a function call like C<NOW()> or similar, then you
can provide them as a scalarref:

  database->quick_insert('mytable', { foo => 'Bar', timestamp => \'NOW()' });

Of course, if you do that, you must be careful to avoid SQL injection attacks!
=cut

sub quick_insert {
    my ($self, $table_name, $data) = @_;
    return $self->_quick_query('INSERT', $table_name, $data);
}

=item quick_update

  database->quick_update('mytable', { id => 42 }, { foo => 'Baz' });

Given a table name, a hashref describing a where clause and a hashref of
changes, update a row.

As per quick_insert, if you need any of the values to be interpolated straight
in the SQL, for e.g. to use a function call, provide a scalarref:

  database->quick_update('mytable', { id => 42 }, { counter => \'counter + 1' });

Of course, if you do that, you must be careful to avoid SQL injection attacks!

=cut

sub quick_update {
    my ($self, $table_name, $where, $data) = @_;
    return $self->_quick_query('UPDATE', $table_name, $data, $where);
}


=item quick_delete

  database->quick_delete($table, {  id => 42 });

Given a table name and a hashref to describe the rows which should be deleted
(the where clause - see below for further details), delete them.

=cut

sub quick_delete {
    my ($self, $table_name, $where) = @_;
    return $self->_quick_query('DELETE', $table_name, undef, $where);
}


=item quick_select

  my $row  = database->quick_select($table, { id => 42 });
  my @rows = database->quick_select($table, { id => 42 });

Given a table name and a hashref of where clauses (see below for explanation),
and an optional hashref of options, returns either the first matching 
row as a hashref if called in scalar context, or a list of matching rows 
as hashrefs if called in list context.  The third argument is a hashref of
options to allow additional control, as documented below.  For backwards
compatibility, it can also be an arrayref of column names, which acts in the
same way as the C<columns> option.

The options you can provide are:

=over 4

=item C<columns>

An arrayref of column names to return, if you only want certain columns returned

=item C<order_by>

Specify how the results should be ordered.  This option can take various values:

=over 4

=item * a straight scalar or arrayref sorts by the given column(s):

    { order_by => 'foo' }           # equivalent to "ORDER BY foo"
    { order_by => [ qw(foo bar) ] } # equiv to "ORDER BY foo,bar"

=item * a hashref of C<order => column name>, e.g.:

    { order_by => { desc => 'foo' } } # equiv to ORDER BY foo DESC
    { order_by => [ { desc => 'foo' }, { asc => 'bar' } ] }
       # above is equiv to ORDER BY foo DESC, bar ASC

=back

=item C<limit>

Limit how many records will be returned; equivalent to e.g. C<LIMIT 1> in an SQL
query.  If called in scalar context, an implicit LIMIT 1 will be added to the
query anyway, so you needn't add it yourself.

An example of using options to control the results you get back:

    # Get the name & phone number of the 10 highest-paid men:
    database->quick_select(
        'employees', 
        { gender => 'male' },
        { order_by => 'salary', limit => 10, columns => [qw(name phone)] }
    );

=cut

=item C<offset> number

C<Offset> says to skip that many rows before beginning to return rows (postgresql).


Example:

    # Get the name & phone number of the 10 highest-paid men starting from 11th:
    database->quick_select(
        'employees', 
        { gender => 'male' },
        { order_by => 'salary', offset => 10, limit => 10, columns => [qw(name phone)] }
    );


=cut

sub quick_select {
    my ($self, $table_name, $where, $opts) = @_;

    # For backwards compatibility, accept an arrayref of column names as the 3rd
    # arg, instead of an arrayref of options:
    if ($opts && ref $opts eq 'ARRAY') {
        $opts = { columns => $opts };
    }

    # Make sure to call _quick_query in the same context we were called.
    # This is a little ugly, rewrite this perhaps.
    if (wantarray) {
        return ($self->_quick_query('SELECT', $table_name, $opts, $where));
    } else {
        return $self->_quick_query('SELECT', $table_name, $opts, $where);
    }
}

=back

=item quick_lookup

  my $id  = database->quick_lookup($table, { email => $params->{'email'} }, 'userid' );

This is a bit of syntactic sugar when you just want to lookup a specific
field, such as when you're converting an email address to a userid (say
during a login handler.)

This call always returns a single scalar value, not a hashref of the
entire row (or partial row) like most of the other methods in this library. 

Returns undef when there's no matching row or no such field found in 
the results.

=cut

sub quick_lookup {
    my ($self, $table_name, $where, $data) = @_;
    my $opts = { columns => [$data] };
    my $row = $self->_quick_query('SELECT', $table_name, $opts, $where);

    return ( $row && exists $row->{$data} ) ? $row->{$data} : undef;
}

=item quick_count

  my $count = database->quick_count($table,
                                    { email => $params->{'email'} });

This is syntactic sugar to return a count of all rows which match your
parameters, useful for pagination.

This call always returns a single scalar value, not a hashref of the
entire row (or partial row) like most of the other methods in this
library.

=cut

    my $opts = {}; #Options are irrelevant for a count.
    my @row = $self->_quick_query('COUNT', $table_name, $opts, $where);

    return ( @row ) ? $row[0] : undef ;
}

# The 3rd arg, $data, has a different meaning depending on the type of query
# (no, I don't like that much; I may refactor this soon to use named params).
# For INSERT/UPDATE queries, it'll be a hashref of field => value.
# For SELECT queries, it'll be a hashref of additional options.
# For DELETE queries, it's unused.

All of the convenience methods provided take care to quote table and column
names using DBI's C<quote_identifier>, and use parameterised queries to avoid
SQL injection attacks.  See L<http://www.bobby-tables.com/> for why this is
important, if you're not familiar with it.


=head1 WHERE clauses as hashrefs

C<quick_update>, C<quick_delete> and C<quick_select> take a hashref of WHERE
clauses.  This is a hashref of field => 'value', each of which will be
included in the WHERE clause used, for instance:

  { id => 42 }

Will result in an SQL query which would include:

  WHERE id = 42

When more than one field => value pair is given, they will be ANDed together:

  { foo => 'Bar', bar => 'Baz' }

Will result in:

  WHERE foo = 'Bar' AND bar = 'Baz'

(Actually, parameterised queries will be used, with placeholders, so SQL
injection attacks will not work, but it's easier to illustrate as though the
values were interpolated directly.  Don't worry, they're not.)

With the same idea in mind, you can check if a value is NULL with:

  { foo => undef }

This will be correctly rewritten to C<foo IS NULL>.

You can pass an empty hashref if you  want all rows, e.g.:

  database->quick_select('mytable', {});

... is the same as C<"SELECT * FROM 'mytable'">

If you pass in an arrayref as the value, you can get a set clause as in the
following example:

 { foo => [ 'bar', 'baz', 'quux' ] } 

... it's the same as C<WHERE foo IN ('bar', 'baz', 'quux')>

If you need additional flexibility, you can build fairly complex where 
clauses by passing a hashref of condition operators and values as the 
value to the column field key.

Currently recognized operators are:

=over

=item 'like'

 { foo => { 'like' => '%bar%' } } 

... same as C<WHERE foo LIKE '%bar%'>

=item 'ilike'

Postgres-specific - same as 'like', but case-insensitive.

=item 'gt' / 'ge'

 'greater than' or 'greater or equal to'
  
 { foo => { 'ge' => '42' } } 

... same as C<WHERE foo E<gt>= '42'>

=item 'lt' / 'le'

 'less than' or 'less or equal to'

 { foo => { 'lt' => '42' } } 

... same as C<WHERE foo E<lt> '42'>

=item 'eq' / 'ne' / 'is'

 'equal' or 'not equal' or 'is'

 { foo => { 'ne' => 'bar' } }

... same as C<WHERE foo != 'bar'>

=back

You can also include a key named 'not' with a true value in the hashref 
which will (attempt) to negate the other operator(s). 

 { foo => { 'like' => '%bar%', 'not' => 1 } }

... same as C<WHERE foo NOT LIKE '%bar%'>

If you use undef as the value for an operator hashref it will be 
replaced with 'NULL' in the query.

If that's not flexible enough, you can pass in your own scalar WHERE clause 
string B<BUT> there's no automatic sanitation on that - if you suffer 
from a SQL injection attack - don't blame me!
Don't forget to use C<quote()>/C<quote_identifier()> on it then.
