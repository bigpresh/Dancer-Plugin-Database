=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Dancer;
    use Dancer::Plugin::Database;

    # Calling the database keyword will get you a connected database handle:
    get '/widget/view/:id' => sub {
        my $sth = database->prepare(
            'select * from widgets where id = ?',
        );
        $sth->execute(params->{id});
        template 'display_widget', { widget => $sth->fetchrow_hashref };
    };

    # The handle is a Dancer::Plugin::Database::Handle object, which subclasses
    # DBI's DBI::db handle and adds a few convenience features, for example:
    get '/insert/:name' => sub {
        database->quick_insert('people', { name => params->{name} });
    };

    get '/users/:id' => sub {
        template 'display_user', {
            person => database->quick_select('users', { id => params->{id} }),
        };
    };

    dance;

Database connection details are read from your Dancer application config - see
below.


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides an easy way to obtain a connected DBI database handle by simply calling
the database keyword within your L<Dancer> application

Returns a L<Dancer::Plugin::Database::Handle> object, which is a subclass of
L<DBI>'s C<DBI::db> connection handle object, so it does everything you'd expect
to do with DBI, but also adds a few convenience methods.  See the documentation
for L<Dancer::Plugin::Database::Handle> for full details of those.

Takes care of ensuring that the database handle is still connected and valid.
If the handle was last asked for more than C<connection_check_threshold> seconds
ago, it will check that the connection is still alive, using either the 
C<< $dbh->ping >> method if the DBD driver supports it, or performing a simple
no-op query against the database if not.  If the connection has gone away, a new
connection will be obtained and returned.  This avoids any problems for
a long-running script where the connection to the database might go away.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

Connection details will be taken from your Dancer application config file, and
should be specified as, for example: 

    plugins:
        Database:
            driver: 'mysql'
            database: 'test'
            host: 'localhost'
            username: 'myusername'
            password: 'mypassword'
            connection_check_threshold: 10
            dbi_params:
                RaiseError: 1
                AutoCommit: 1
            on_connect_do: ["SET NAMES 'utf8'", "SET CHARACTER SET 'utf8'" ]
            log_queries: 1

The C<connection_check_threshold> setting is optional, if not provided, it
will default to 30 seconds.  If the database keyword was last called more than
this number of seconds ago, a quick check will be performed to ensure that we
still have a connection to the database, and will reconnect if not.  This
handles cases where the database handle hasn't been used for a while and the
underlying connection has gone away.

The C<dbi_params> setting is also optional, and if specified, should be settings
which can be passed to C<< DBI->connect >> as its third argument; see the L<DBI>
documentation for these.

The optional C<on_connect_do> setting is an array of queries which should be
performed when a connection is established; if given, each query will be
performed using C<< $dbh->do >>.

The optional C<log_queries> setting enables logging of queries generated by the
helper functions C<quick_insert> et al in L<Dancer::Plugin::Database::Handle>.
If you enable it, generated queries will be logged at 'debug' level.  Be aware
that they will contain the data you're passing to/from the database, so be
careful not to enable this option in production, where you could inadvertently
log sensitive information.

If you prefer, you can also supply a pre-crafted DSN using the C<dsn> setting;
in that case, it will be used as-is, and the driver/database/host settings will 
be ignored.  This may be useful if you're using some DBI driver which requires 
a peculiar DSN.


=head2 DEFINING MULTIPLE CONNECTIONS

If you need to connect to multiple databases, this is easy - just list them in
your config under C<connections> as shown below:

    plugins:
        Database:
            connections:
                foo:
                    driver: "SQLite"
                    database: "foo.sqlite"
                bar:
                    driver: "mysql"
                    host: "localhost"
                    ....

Then, you can call the C<database> keyword with the name of the database
connection you want, for example:

    my $foo_dbh = database('foo');
    my $bar_dbh = database('bar');


=head1 RUNTIME CONFIGURATION

You can pass a hashref to the C<database()> keyword to provide configuration
details to override any in the config file at runtime if desired, for instance:

    my $dbh = database({ driver => 'SQLite', database => $filename });

(Thanks to Alan Haggai for this feature.)

=head1 AUTOMATIC UTF-8 SUPPORT

As of version 1.20, if your application is configured to use UTF-8 (you've
defined the C<charset> setting in your app config as C<UTF-8>) then support for
UTF-8 for the database connection will be enabled, if we know how to do so for
the database driver in use.

If you do not want this behaviour, set C<auto_utf8> to a false value when
providing the connection details.



=head1 GETTING A DATABASE HANDLE

Calling C<database> will return a connected database handle; the first time it is
called, the plugin will establish a connection to the database, and return a
reference to the DBI object.  On subsequent calls, the same DBI connection
object will be returned, unless it has been found to be no longer usable (the
connection has gone away), in which case a fresh connection will be obtained.

If you have declared named connections as described above in 'DEFINING MULTIPLE
CONNECTIONS', then calling the database() keyword with the name of the
connection as specified in the config file will get you a database handle
connected with those details.

You can also pass a hashref of settings if you wish to provide settings at
runtime.


=head1 CONVENIENCE FEATURES (quick_select, quick_update, quick_insert, quick_delete)

The handle returned by the C<database> keyword is a
L<Dancer::Plugin::Database::Handle> object, which subclasses the C<DBI::db> DBI
connection handle.  This means you can use it just like you'd normally use a DBI
handle, but extra convenience methods are provided, as documented in the POD for
L<Dancer::Plugin::Database::Handle>.

Examples:

  # Quickly fetch the (first) row whose ID is 42 as a hashref:
  my $row = database->quick_select($table_name, { id => 42 });

  # Fetch all badgers as an array of hashrefs:
  my @badgers = database->quick_select('animals', { genus => 'Mellivora' });

  # Update the row where the 'id' column is '42', setting the 'foo' column to
  # 'Bar':
  database->quick_update($table_name, { id => 42 }, { foo => 'Bar' });

  # Insert a new row, using a named connection (see above)
  database('connectionname')->quick_insert($table_name, { foo => 'Bar' });

  # Delete the row with id 42:
  database->quick_delete($table_name, { id => 42 });

  # Fetch all rows from a table (since version 1.30):
  database->quick_select($table_name, {});
