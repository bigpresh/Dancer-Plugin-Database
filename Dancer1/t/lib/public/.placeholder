This directory is empty on purpose, and this file is here solely so that git
tracks it, as git won't track empty directories (mostly because it doesn't track
directories at all, only the files in them).

This otherwise-empty directory is needed to avoid a strange bug on Windows 
systems where Cwd::realpath() croaks if they don't exist.
