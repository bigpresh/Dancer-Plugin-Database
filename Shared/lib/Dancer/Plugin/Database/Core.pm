=head1 NAME

Dancer::Plugin::Database::Core - Shared core for D1 and D2 Database plugins

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.04

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.04';

my %handles;
# Hashref used as key for default handle, so we don't have a magic value that
# the user could use for one of their connection names and cause problems
# (Kudos to Igor Bujna for the idea)
my $def_handle = {};

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module should not be used directly. It is a shared library for
L<Dancer::Plugin::Database> and L<Dancer2::Plugin::Database> modules.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 database

Implements the C<database> keyword.
