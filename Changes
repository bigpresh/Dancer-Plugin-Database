Revision history for Dancer-Plugin-Database

1.21    2011-03-06
        - Bugfix: return undef if connection fails, rather than attempting to
          re-bless and blowing up. Fixes GH-7, thanks to Nick Hibma

1.20    2011-02-23
        - New feature - automatically enable UTF-8 support if the app's charset
          setting is set to 'UTF-8' and we know how to enable UTF-8 support for
          the database driver in use.  This can be disabled with the new
          auto_utf8 setting in the plugin's config.
        - Bugfix - create test DB in memory, not a file named ":memory" by
          accident.  This should fix test failures on Windows, e.g.:

1.11    2011-02-18
        - Fix bug RT #65825 - quick_select didn't actually use the where clause
          correctly.
        - Extended test suite.
        
1.10    2011-02-11
        - New feature quick_select
        - Fix bug RT #65651, quick_insert generating SQL which MySQL/Postgres
          didn't accept due to use of quote() rather than quote_identifier(),
          thanks to Christian Sánchez and Michael Stiller
        - Fix GH #5 - named connections not working properly - thanks to
          "crayon"

1.00    2011-01-10
        - Bumping to 1.00 to signify being ready for production use, for users
          who have a mistrust of 0.x version numbers.
        - Applied Alan Haggai's changes to allow a hashref of settings to be
          passed to the database() keyword at runtime.  Thanks Alan!
          (This was released as 0.91_01 for testing first.)

0.91    2010-12-21
        - Whoah - didn't "use strict" in Dancer::Plugin::Database::Handle!
          Last tweak release, then I'll push 1.00 out soon.

0.90    2010-12-10
        - New features quick_insert, quick_update, quick_delete.  The database
          keyword now returns a Dancer::Plugin::Database::Handle object, which
          is a subclass of DBI::db so does everything you'd expect a DBI
          connection handle to do, but adds extra convenience methods.
        - Fixed test failures on Windows systems.

       (Large version bump due to new features; assuming there are no reports of
       issues with this version (there shouldn't be!), I'll release 1.0 soon,
       for those who look for a >= 1.0 version number as an indication of being
       production-ready.


0.12    2010-12-03
        - Documentation mentioned connectivity-check-threshold instead of the
          correct connection_check_threshold.  Thanks to bessarabov for catching
          this and submitting corrections via GitHub!

0.11    2010-11-09 (CoD Black Ops day!)
        - Bugfix: pass connection settings when reconnecting, too.

0.10    2010-10-30
        - Add some proper tests [Franck Cuny]

0.09    2010-09-28
        - Allow definition of multiple connections, and accept a param to the
          database() keyword to specify which connection you need a handle for.
          This was released as 0.08_01 for testing.

0.08    2010-09-14
        - Bugfix - make SQLite DWIMmery from previous version actually work.

0.07    2010-09-06
        - Extra params in DSN (database, host, port) should be separated with
          semi-colons, not colons.  Thanks to Steve Atkins for reporting this.
        - Documentation update to reflect use of $dbh->ping
        - If connecting to SQLite, which requires 'dbname' rather than
          'database', provide 'dbname' instead, so it will Just Work

0.06    2010-06-15
        - Stupid typo fix in documentation for features added in 0.05.  I wish
          I'd spotted this mistake before releasing 0.05, rather than just
          after!

0.05    2010-06-15
        - Allow parameters to be passed to DBI->connect call (e.g. RaiseError),
          and support providing a set of statements to execute upon connection.
          Thanks to Igor Bujna for providing this feature!

0.04    2010-05-20
        - If DBD driver does not implement ping(), perform our own connection
          check by performing a simple query.  This will check that the DB
          connection is still alive, and avoid needless re-connects, which are
          expensive.  Also seems to fix a problem Tadzik saw with a warning from
          DBD::SQLite when the old handle was thrown away.

0.03    2010-05-17
        - Fix warning where $last_connection_check was initially undefined but
          used in numeric comparison.  Thanks to Tadzik for reporting.

0.02    2010-04-18
        Documentation fixes, thanks to "mrpants" on Github:
        - Plugin names in config.yml are case-sensitive for current CPAN
          releases of Dancer; my commit fdc3f3 makes it case-insenitive, but
          that hasn't hit CPAN yet, so people using CPAN releases could be
          confused
        - stray trailing single-quote in example config

0.01    2010-04-14
        Initial version developed.
